# Welcome to Arcade UI

**Arcade UI** is a collection of beautifully crafted Flutter widgets that you can copy and paste into your projects. No packages to install, no version conflicts—just pure Flutter code that you own.

## Philosophy

We believe in **copy, not package**. Instead of adding another dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`, simply browse our widget gallery, find what you need, and copy the code directly into your project. This gives you:

- **Full control** over the code
- **No version conflicts** with other packages
- **Easy customization** to fit your design needs
- **Zero dependencies** (or minimal, well-documented ones)

## What's Inside

Arcade UI features widgets across multiple categories:

- **Backgrounds**: Animated backgrounds like FlickeringGrid and BlackHoleBackground
- **Navigations**: Dock-style navigation components
- **Borders**: Glowing and animated border effects
- **Cards**: Interactive 3D card widgets
- And more coming soon!
